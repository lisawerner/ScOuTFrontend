# ScOuT

ScOuT is an application for planing events.
It helps users to get an overview of undone tasks and gives him reminder if a task gets done-status of coming through.

ScOuT is realised especially for teams like clubs but can also used by work or familiar groups.
It differ from other existing tools for planing by making a difference between a project and an event.
Projects are mostly organised once a time but events like tent camps in Scout Organisations are organised every year again.
The repeating factor is much higher and the cost to refactor an old project for using it again ist to high for users by using existing tools.
ScOuT reduce this costs by using templates, which assume more of the refactoring steps.
