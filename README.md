# ScOuT

ScOuT is an application for planning events.
It helps users to get an overview of undone tasks and give them reminders if a task gets the done-status of coming through.

ScOuT is realised especially for teams like clubss but can also be used by work or familiar groups.
It differs from other existing tools for planning by making a difference between projects and events.
Projects are mostly organised once a time, but events like tent camps in Scout Organisations are organised every year again.
The repeating factor is much higher and the cost to refactor an old project for using it again is to high for users by using existing tools.
ScOuT reduces this cost by using templates, which take more over of the refactoring steps.

## History
